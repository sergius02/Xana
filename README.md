A web browser made by and for developers ü§ìÔ∏è

## What? Another web browser? ü§îÔ∏è

With this browser i try to make a tool that helps every web developer. Instead of need to install an unlimited number of plugins, how about if you only need to install one app.

For the moment this is a VERY, VERY (really VERY üòπÔ∏è) simple web browser, as it's a work in progress.

It's based on Webkit, and inspired in other great browsers like [Midori](https://github.com/midori-browser?type=source)üòªÔ∏è and [Ephemereal](https://github.com/cassidyjames/ephemeral)üòªÔ∏è.

Developed for [Elementary OS](https://elementary.io/es/).
